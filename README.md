This is a calculator for the moon phases of my fantasy world, Ixchel. It can be accessed at https://lfleming-314.github.io/Ixchel-Moon-Phases/.

The world has four moons:
Oluris (purple): 28 day orbit
Syldric (green): 44 day orbit
Caphriel (silver): 100 day orbit
Lyso (red): 156 day orbit

The world has its own calendar, with 13 months which each have 28 days.
The calendar is divided into two eras called Saros 1 and Saros 2. Each saros has 2475 years and begins with year 0.
In Saros 2, there is a leap day called the Biennial, which happens at the beginning of every second year.

The world is divided into two planetoids, called Salix (north) and Senna (south). The orientation of the moons changes depending on which planetoid you are viewing them from, which can be toggled in the top menu.

The code I used to draw the moon phases comes from https://codepen.io/anowodzinski/pen/ZWKXPQ.
